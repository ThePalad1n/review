Overview
In this unit you will be introduced to the concept of saving, or persisting, user data.
There are two main types of storage we will use to save data:
Client Side Storage: uses cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage to save and reuse user data across a userâ€™s session.
Server Side Storage: saves user info to a database that can be reused across multiple devices and sessions. We'll use Firebase to accomplish this.
You'll also cover working with Date objects in JavaScript using the Moment.js library. Dates come up often in programming, whether you're building a scheduling application, todo-list, e-commerce app, etc. You'll also use the Moment.js library to do things such as converting between various date formats and finding the difference between two dates.

Overview
In this unit, we add the final layer to our stack: the database. While it is the last, it is by no means the least. Databases are the foundation of full-stack web applications. Although we began our journey on the client-side, it will be more useful from this point on to approach application development from the bottom up. When using our applications, what is most important to our users is being able to store and retrieve data. Once we determine how we will model that data, we can then set about determining the best way to deliver it to the front-end via our server-side API.
In simplest terms, a database is a collection of data stored electronically. The database management system (DBMS) we will be using in this unit is MySQL. MySQL is the most popular SQL database. The SQL in MySQL is short for Structured Query Language, and that structure is relational. A relational database stores and finds data based on its relationship to other data in the database. Relational databases are tabular, meaning data is stored in tables composed of rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet.
We will begin the unit using GUI's, such as Workbench or Sequel Pro, to interface with our databases, but by the end of the unit you should be proficient using the MySQL command prompt. We will then connect our Node.js servers to our MySQL databases to perform queries based on client requests and return responses accordingly.
