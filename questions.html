                                <li>What is a CDN?</li>
                                <p>A CDN is a <strong> content delivery network</strong> refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets
                                    needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.</p>
                                <li>What is a CSS framework?</li>
                                <p>A CSS framework is a library allowing for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with
                                    more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and focused around interactive UI patterns. This detail differentiates CSS frameworks from other JavaScript frameworks.</p>
                                <li>What are three benefits of using a CSS framework?</li>
                                <p>They can help you learn CSS, They provide code that you just donâ€™t need to write from scratch every time, like resets, They relieve cross-browser concerns, It helps you build good habits, They encourage grid based design,
                                    They come with documentation, They lay groundwork. </p>

                                <li>Explain the importance of CSS resets and cross-browser compatibility</li>
                                <p>At the beginning of this process, using a CSS reset for better cross-browser compatibility will better allow the developer to create changes within a global HTML sequence to save time and ensure universal uniformity across
                                    various browsers.</p>
                                <li>Explain and implement content delivery network links in HTML files</li>
                                <p>Servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are dispersed at geographically different locations, caching the contents
                                    of the page. When a user requests a webpage that is part of a content delivery network, the CDN will redirect the request from the originating site's server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver
                                    the cached content. CDNs will also communicate with the originating server to deliver any content that has not been previously cached.</p>

                            <li>What are five fundamental concepts of programming?</li>
                            <p>The five basic concepts of any programming language are variables, controll structures, data structures, syntax, and tools.</p>
                            <li>What is object-oriented programming?</li>
                            <p>An object-oriented programming language (OOPL) is a high-level programming language based on the object-oriented model. To perform object-oriented programming, one needs an object-oriented programming language. Many modern
                                programming languages are object-oriented, however some older programming languages, such as Pascal, do offer object-oriented versions. </p>
                            <li>What is a function?</li>
                            <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.</p>

                                <p>Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. An object, is a reference data type.</p>

                                <p>Declarations are loaded before any code can run. Function declarations load before any code is executed while Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code. Similar to the var statement,
                                    function declarations are hoisted to the top of other code.</p>
